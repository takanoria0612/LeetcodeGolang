# Container With Most Water

## Problem Statement

Given n non-negative integers a1, a2, ..., an , where each represents a point at coordinate (i, ai). n vertical lines are drawn such that the two endpoints of line i is at (i, ai) and (i, 0). Find two lines, which together with x-axis forms a container, such that the container contains the most water.

## Solutions

- `solution1.go`: Implements a brute-force approach to find the maximum water container.
- `solution2.go`: Uses a two-pointer technique to optimize the search for the largest water container.

## Usage

Run the solutions using the main.go in the root directory of the project.
